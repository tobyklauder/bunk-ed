## a lightweight application to group campers into their cabins

This small a lightweight application was built for SAMBICA Camps and Retreat Center during the Summmer of 2023. It is open sourced here in hopes that other camps that need to organize their campers into cabins and desire an automatic system are able to easily do so! We believe in sharing our tools and progress with others to the benefit of the kingdom of God! 

Previously, they had been creating all cabin assignments for campers by hand, which caused hours of labor on the part of the full time staff at the organization. 

This system takes in a .csv file. The file must include columns: "Name", "Age", "Grade", "Gender" and any number of columns containing the word "Buddy". 

Campers will be matched to other campers of the same grade. Campers will also be reasonably placed with a buddy of their choosing if their buddy is also within the reasonable user defined paramaters for age and grade ranges. The system is designed for single gender cabins with the values "Male" or "Female". 

# Overhaul in progress. Further documentation coming soon.
